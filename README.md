# Bioinformatics scripts

- These are scripts I have found to be useful when conducting bioinformatic analysis

<br>

## Contents

### CheckSampleComps.sh
- Runs `kraken2` and analyzes which organisms the reads in the sample may be from
- `KrakenPiePlots.py` is used within the RunK2.sh script

<br>

### pull-msa-regions.py
- Exctracts region(s) of interest from an MSA and outputs the regions into a fasta file
