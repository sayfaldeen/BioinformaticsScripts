# Picklegram Code Directory

- This directory contains code for the generation of 'picklegrams' from the `gene_presence_abscence.csv` file generated by Roary

## Using the code
- This code can be used in two main ways:
	1. Running the `make_picklegram.py` script from the command-line and providing arguments
		- This is the less flexible option
	2. Importing the `pangenome.py` module into an IPYNB as demonstrated the in the example notebook present in this directory
		- More flexible as it allows finer control over how to slice the data and how to combine and label the images
